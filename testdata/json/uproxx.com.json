Though the Dakota Access Pipeline construction is a relatively new development, it touches upon a conflict that has been brewing for centuries, and those known as \u201cwater protectors\u201d are now displaying unprecedented resistance.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Though the mainstream media coverage of the ongoing movement has been sparse, the effects may be historic. The Sioux and their supporters have been greeted with not only tear gas from riot-gear clad officers but\n  <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/news/native-american-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-violent/\">\n   attack dogs\n  </a>\n  , rubber bullets, and even\n  <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/news/standing-rock-water-cannons-protesters-freezing/\">\n   water cannons\n  </a>\n  that have been deployed in below-freezing weather. The latter method may cost\n  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/dakota-access-pipeline-protester-seriously-hurt-during-police-standoff-standing-rock?CMP=twt_a-environment_b-gdneco\">\n   one woman her arm\n  </a>\n  after it was, according to her family, nearly blown off her body. And on Monday, several protesters filed an\n  <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/11/28/dapl-protesters-file-brutality-lawsuit.html\">\n   excessive force lawsuit\n  </a>\n  against law enforcement officials.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It\u2019s worth noting that the protests have been\n  <a href=\"http://linkis.com/BUWdq\">\n   characterized by authorities\n  </a>\n  as \u201criots\u201d despite no weaponry being carried by the Native Americans. All known attacks have been carried out by either government-sanctioned forces or the pipeline construction crews. This violence\n  <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/news/native-american-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-violent/\">\n   began in September\n  </a>\n  and continued throughout Thanksgiving weekend in a manner that\u2019s\n  <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/thanksgiving-food-thought-what-table-full-foreigners-taught-me-about-most-american-holidays-1485690\">\n   almost as ironic\n  </a>\n  as the contemporary holiday celebrations themselves.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Standing Rock contends that the pipeline will destroy sacred burial ground and not only contaminate their water supply but the drinking water of millions of other U.S. citizens. These fears are not unfounded. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has\n  <a href=\"http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline/library/data-stats/pipelineincidenttrends\">\n   recorded 3,300 oil and gas pipeline leaks\n  </a>\n  in the U.S. since 2010. On average, that\u2019s more than one leak per day, and one must also consider the size of this project. According to the\n  <a href=\"http://www.daplpipelinefacts.com/docs-dapl/08092016/DAPL_FactSheet33-8_09_16.pdf\">\n   Dakota Access Pipeline fact sheet\n  </a>\n  , the finished project would transfer up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil each day.\n </p>\n <p>\n  For perspective\u2019s sake, the Yellowstone River fell prey to a January\n  <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/oil-spills-in-yellowstone-river-after-pipeline-leak1/\">\n   breach in the Poplar pipeline system, which transfers about 42,000 barrels per day\n  </a>\n  . This disaster dumped 1,200 barrels of crude oil daily into the water. A breach from the Dakota Access Pipeline could be at least ten times worse. Even a small spill would contaminate the river, and a large spill would be catastrophic. Beyond water, which\n  <em>\n   is\n  </em>\n  life, there\u2019s the question of treaty violation, which only reinforces the centuries of mistreatment known by Native Americans.\n </p>\n <div>\n  <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-11.jpg%20650w,%20http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-11.jpg?quality=90&w=173%20173w\" srcset=\"http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-11.jpg 650w, http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-11.jpg?quality=90&w=173 173w\">\n   <p>\n    Getty Image\n   </p>\n  </img>\n </div>\n</div>",
