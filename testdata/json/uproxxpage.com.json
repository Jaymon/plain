All known attacks have been carried out by either government-sanctioned forces or the pipeline construction crews. This violence\n   <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/news/native-american-dakota-access-pipeline-protest-violent/\">\n    began in September\n   </a>\n   and continued throughout Thanksgiving weekend in a manner that\u2019s\n   <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/thanksgiving-food-thought-what-table-full-foreigners-taught-me-about-most-american-holidays-1485690\">\n    almost as ironic\n   </a>\n   as the contemporary holiday celebrations themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Standing Rock contends that the pipeline will destroy sacred burial ground and not only contaminate their water supply but the drinking water of millions of other U.S. citizens. These fears are not unfounded. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has\n   <a href=\"http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/pipeline/library/data-stats/pipelineincidenttrends\">\n    recorded 3,300 oil and gas pipeline leaks\n   </a>\n   in the U.S. since 2010. On average, that\u2019s more than one leak per day, and one must also consider the size of this project. According to the\n   <a href=\"http://www.daplpipelinefacts.com/docs-dapl/08092016/DAPL_FactSheet33-8_09_16.pdf\">\n    Dakota Access Pipeline fact sheet\n   </a>\n   , the finished project would transfer up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil each day.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   For perspective\u2019s sake, the Yellowstone River fell prey to a January\n   <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/oil-spills-in-yellowstone-river-after-pipeline-leak1/\">\n    breach in the Poplar pipeline system, which transfers about 42,000 barrels per day\n   </a>\n   . This disaster dumped 1,200 barrels of crude oil daily into the water. A breach from the Dakota Access Pipeline could be at least ten times worse. Even a small spill would contaminate the river, and a large spill would be catastrophic. Beyond water, which\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   life, there\u2019s the question of treaty violation, which only reinforces the centuries of mistreatment known by Native Americans.\n  </p>\n  <div>\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-11.jpg%20650w,%20http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-11.jpg?quality=90&w=173%20173w\" srcset=\"http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-11.jpg 650w, http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-11.jpg?quality=90&w=173 173w\">\n    <p>\n     Getty Image\n    </p>\n   </img>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <p>\n   <span>\n    Chapter 1\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The overarching issue of Native American sovereignty runs parallel to environmental concerns here. The crude oil pipeline began as a mammoth $3.8 billion project, which would stretch 1,172 miles from North Dakota\u2019s Bakken oil fields and traverse through South Dakota and Iowa all the way to Illinois. Notably, the original path would have\n   <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/previously-proposed-route-dakota-access-pipeline-rejected/story?id=43274356\">\n    crossed the Missouri River\n   </a>\n   near Bismarck. However, this predominantly white city rejected the path out of oil-spill fears. So, the project rerouted the point of water crossing southward, which lands just north of Standing Rock\u2019s reservation. In response, the Sioux established a camp on the Missouri River\u2019s banks in April.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The Sioux argue that the pipeline crosses sacred burial grounds. Although the land in question is technically private property owned by the pipeline developer (and does not involve reservation land), the proposed pipeline route would run under the Missouri river, half a mile away from the reservation. And a\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   report\n   <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/opinion/time-to-move-the-standing-rock-pipeline.html?_r=0&mtrref=uproxx.com&gwh=2B859311AD55C4834D897FDBAAFBBCB8&gwt=pay&assetType=opinion\">\n    notes how\n   </a>\n   \u201cthe pipeline crosses disputed Sioux land that was promised to the tribe in the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie but was later taken away.\u201d A recent\n   <em>\n    NY Times\n   </em>\n   op-ed also\n   <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/opinion/time-to-move-the-standing-rock-pipeline.html?_r=0\">\n    summarized the symbolic nature of the conflict\n   </a>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote>\n   <p>\n    The confrontation cannot help summoning a wretched history. Not far from Standing Rock, in the Black Hills of South Dakota, sacred land was stolen from the Sioux, plundered for gold and other minerals, and then carved into four monumental presidential heads: an American shrine built from a brazen act of defacement.\n   </p>\n   <p>\n    The Sioux know as well as any of America\u2019s native peoples that justice is a shifting concept, that treaties, laws and promises can wilt under the implacable pressure for mineral extraction. But without relitigating the history of the North American conquest, perhaps the protesters can achieve their aim to stop or reroute the pipeline.\n   </p>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>\n   The\n   <a href=\"https://ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=42\">\n    Fort Laramie treaty\n   </a>\n   meant to bring peace between whites and the Sioux settlers of the Dakota Territory\u2019s Black Hills. The stated conditions included the\n   <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/2016/11/25/standing-rock-sioux-making-last-stand-block-dakota-access-pipeline/\">\n    northern border of the Heart River\n   </a>\n   that (per the\n   <em>\n    Denver Post\n   </em>\n   ) \u201cwinds up to Bismarck, about 25 miles north of the Cannonball River that was declared the northern border by an act of Congress in 1889.\u201d The clashes between protesters and authorities over the pipeline have all occurred very close to the Cannonball. This arguably violates the treaty that aimed to preserve Native American lands and sovereignty as well as prevent the struggle we\u2019re seeing today.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Recently, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ordered protesters to\n   <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/11/25/503379401/army-corps-of-engineers-tells-pipeline-protesters-to-leave-camp-by-dec-5\">\n    clear the camp by December 5\n   </a>\n   or be subject to prosecution for trespassing on \u201cCorps-managed land.\u201d The Corps cites \u201cviolent confrontations between protestors and law enforcement officials\u201d and the \u201charsh North Dakota winter conditions\u201d as reasons for the ban.

Here\u2019s a photo of Taboo Nawasha (of the Black Eyed Peas) with Yearwood at a recent Standing Rock benefit, held by the Hip Hop Caucus.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p>\n   During this post-election haze \u2014 while many are either performing a victory dance or wallowing within a pit of depression \u2014 Yearwood, a\n   <a href=\"http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/liberate-your-space/vote-hope-2008-2-lennox-yearwood\">\n    military veteran\n   </a>\n   who recognizes climate change as an issue of national security, does not rest. His unyielding optimism is infectious, and he maintains hope for the peaceful resistance,\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   We spoke with Reverend Yearwood last week and originally aimed to discuss Trump\u2019s climate change policy. Unfortunately, Trump\u2019s position on the issue is not a deep one and will likely soon change, so we moved beyond that subject.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yearwood remains optimistic that Trump\u2019s victory will inspire a transformation that will overcome the \u201cfear and negativity\u201d of what some supporters perpetuate in his name.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \u201cFrom the n-word to you name it, it\u2019s an endless amount of hate happening in a very short time,\u201d Yearwood told UPROXX. \u201cIt\u2019s only been two weeks! [laughs] Literally in two weeks, there\u2019s been about 500 cases of hate crimes. It is a thing that we definitely need to correct.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The case can be made that much of the hatred comes from a subset of Trump supporters, who embody a deep-seated disrespect for minorities, which is also reflected in the attitudes of law enforcement and private interests towards Standing Rock. Yearwood has visited the area numerous times since the movement began. What our conversation ultimately yielded was a glimpse into life at Standing Rock, beyond the fleeting images we view on social media (actor Matt McGorry\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MattMcGorry/status/803000986855821312\">\n    claims that cell signals are being scrambled\n   </a>\n   to hinder sharing efforts of people at the site). And although the movement has trended on Twitter for months (under the\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/nodapl\">\n    #NoDAPL\n   </a>\n   hashtag), the mainstream media largely ignored the trend.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   On the subject of climate change as well as Standing Rock, Yearwood hopes that Trump will \u201crealize that this is not about profits but about people.\u201d Still, Trump favors fossil fuel reliance (for purposes of job creation and profits), and he reportedly\n   <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trumps-stock-in-dakota-access-oil-pipeline-raises-concerns/\">\n    holds stock shares in Phillips 66\n   </a>\n   , which owns about one-quarter share of Dakota Access.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   You\u2019ll recall that favoring profits over people lead to injustices like\n   <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/tag/flint/\">\n    Flint\n   </a>\n   , MI where an entire community saw their water poisoned by aging lead pipes simply because it was less expensive to reroute the city\u2019s water supply from a corrosive source.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   As Yearwood hints, tools exist for anticipated future battles against Trump: \u201cFor those of us who have studied the Civil Rights Movement, you know, working in a hostile environment. We have seen that demonstration and litigation can be utilized in a very successful manner.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   And so, the Sioux have settled into the encampment in\n   <a href=\"https://twitter.com/APCentralRegion/status/804429572011884544\">\n    what\u2019s being described as\n   </a>\n   the largest tribal gathering in 100 years. Yearwood explains how the winterization of the camp is a constant process. \u201cIt\u2019s a little cold up there as you can imagine,\u201d he laughs.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yet he paints a rather incredible portrait: \u201cThere are 4000 people who are now living there, and so they\u2019re feeding over 4,000 people, their children are going to school at this active protest site, there are, you know, babies being born on the site, on the camp, so it\u2019s an amazing place.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yearwood explains how the daily routine begins with prayer, after which people set about winterizing the camp and preparing food while \u201csome of the escalations are the most horrible things that\u2019s been done by the police.\u201d He feels these abuses are \u201cvery embarrassing for our country.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Weapons are being deployed against the Standing Rock people on a nightly basis, according to Yearwood. However, \u201cthe people, the water protectors, are not using these weapons, and it shows to me how powerful they are. Because they\u2019re using their spiritual guides and aspect, and they\u2019re not only doing it for themselves. Clearly, they are putting\u2026 they\u2019re fighting for clean water for over 17 million people, most of whom are not Native people.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   He feels that Standing Rock gives the American people a lesson in resistance, \u201cand for many of our usual, contemporary, US-based movements, really, they\u2019re putting us to shame.\u201d He believes that the use of spirituality and love, as well as nonviolent resistance, should bring their fight to national prominence. In particular, he singles out \u201chow women have been so amazing and how they\u2019re leading this movement, putting their bodies on the front lines.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <div>\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-7.jpg%20650w,%20http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-7.jpg?quality=90&w=173%20173w\" srcset=\"http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-7.jpg 650w, http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-7.jpg?quality=90&w=173 173w\">\n    <p>\n     Getty Image\n    </p>\n   </img>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <p>\n   <span>\n    Chapter 3\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Although #NoDAPL rides on social media, and several high-profile celebrities (including\n   <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/movies/shailene-woodley-arrest-essay/\">\n    Shailene Woodley\n   </a>\n   , Mark Ruffalo,\n   <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/music/neil-young-thanksgiving-standing-rock/\">\n    Neil Young\n   </a>\n   , and the aforementioned McGorry) have stood in solidarity with the movement, the mainstream media coverage that this struggle has received has been uneven at best. With such a lack of clarity, terminology is important. For instance, while those authorities prefer to describe the Standing Rock encampment occupants as \u201crioters,\u201d the media appears to favor \u201cprotesters.\u201d And the movement itself prefers \u201cwater protectors.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   When asked about this distinction, Yearwood clarifies. \u201cThe camp itself is a protest,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd [that\u2019s] very, very important to recognize, but what we\u2019re witnessing [is] the structural violence that our country has waged and continues to wage on the Native Americans to this day. Now being backed up by the physical violence.\u201d He believes this is the case \u201cbecause the spiritual resistance of the people at Standing Rock is so strong. To me, it\u2019s truly compelling because it makes plain the truth of the oppression and also shows the weakness of the oppressor.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yearwood expresses how the ultimate goal is to \u201ckeep it [the oil] in the ground\u201d and to keep the movement running all winter long, as peacefully as possible.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   \u201cIf this pipeline isn\u2019t done by January 1st, in some cases, the money runs out,\u201d he reasons. \u201cThey could just get more money, but according to their plan, the money runs out, and so, we\u2019re making it much more difficult. We feel that yes, digging things out of the ground, I call it pollution, and with our planet in peril, that should be very difficult to do. For clean energy, it should be as easy as possible. So, the goal here is to make it as difficult as possible for us to rely upon fossil fuels.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   I bring up the so-called Bundy Militia members, who seized an Oregon wildlife refuge by armed force last winter. They were allowed to occupy and weren\u2019t treated as a threat. Yes, one member was\n   <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/news/ammon-bundy-arrest-tarpman-death/\">\n    killed by law enforcement\n   </a>\n   but only after he allegedly\n   <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/news/fbi-releases-unedited-footage-oregon-militia-shootout/\">\n    reached for a gun\n   </a>\n   when his vehicle ran into an embankment. All militants were then\n   <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/news/oregon-standoff-all-defendants-not-guilty/\">\n    cleared by a jury\n   </a>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yearwood finds the difference in how the government treats the two groups to be \u201cvery disturbing, clearly. It lays bare some of the hard pain of racism in this country, how people are treated differently.\u201d He adds that the militants intruded upon federal land, as opposed to the Standing Rock movement: \u201cThis actually\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   their land that they\u2019re fighting for. And I\u2019ve heard that the folks at Dakota Access have the nerve to call these people \u2018squatters\u2019? Like man, how do you get that kind of gall?\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yearwood sees the treatment as clear evidence of \u201cbias in the system.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   The level of disrespect shown towards the water protectors is harsh, and Yearwood says of the Dakota Access company, \u201cI\u2019m not sure they expected \u2026 I think they assumed that the Native Americans would be the path of least resistance. And so it is almost shocking to them that they have the gall themselves to fight against their water being polluted and believing that water is life, that they are water protectors, and that everything comes from that. So I think that fuels the brutality, the lack of humanizing of how they have been approaching.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   Yearwood sees this as a continuation of the sadder aspects of U.S. history: \u201cI think that how we look upon the Natives in this country has been horrible, and this continues that tradition.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <div>\n   <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-9.jpg%20650w,%20http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-9.jpg?quality=90&w=173%20173w\" srcset=\"http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-9.jpg 650w, http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-9.jpg?quality=90&w=173 173w\">\n    <p>\n     Getty Image\n    </p>\n   </img>\n  </div>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <p>\n   <span>\n    Chapter 4\n   </span>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   In November 2015, President Obama\n   <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/06/obama-reject-keystone-pipeline/75293270/\">\n    rejected the proposed Keystone XL\n   </a>\n   pipeline extension after a six-year battle over Nebraska\u2019s Sandhills region.

He\u2019s excited at how the movement has, over the last few years, grown to broaden its attitudes when it comes to race, \u201callowing people of color, like myself\u201d to lead. This change, he says, will position the movement for victory going forward (regardless of Standing Rock\u2019s outcome), \u201cparticularly in this age of an administration that might be kind of hostile\u201d towards environmental issues.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   On behalf of the\n   <a href=\"http://www.hiphopcaucus.org/\">\n    Hip Hop Caucus\n   </a>\n   , Yearwood hopes Obama will soon make a decision, and he leaves a powerful final statement: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you this, the one thing this is so powerful about these people is that they truly believe in the power of the people. And one thing that is a theme in Standing Rock is that organized people beat organized money\n   <em>\n    every single time\n   </em>\n   . And I believe that will happen in this case.\u201d\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <em>\n    Hip Hop Caucus will host a virtual townhall on December 7, 2016 at 8:00 p.m. EST in their ongoing effort to support the #noDAPL movement and educate all Americans. The townhall will include Native American prayers, update on the current state of Standing Rock and the #NoDAPL protest, the environmental injustice implications of the pipeline, an introduction to Hip Hop Caucus, and how anyone can get involved. Rev. Yearwood, Taboo, hip hop star Vic Mensa and other artists will serve as panelists. The townhall can be accessed via RSVP\n    <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/news/standing-rock-protests-motivations-history-interview/5/bitly.com/StandNRock\">\n     here\n    </a>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p>\n   <div>\n    <img alt=\"\" src=\"http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-5.jpg%20650w,%20http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-5.jpg?quality=90&w=173%20173w\" srcset=\"http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-5.jpg 650w, http://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/standing-rock-site-5.jpg?quality=90&w=173 173w\">\n     <p>\n      Getty Image\n     </p>\n    </img>\n   </div>\n  </p>\n </div>\n</div>",
