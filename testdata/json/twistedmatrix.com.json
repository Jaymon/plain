As this post propagated a good many bad ideas about working hours, particularly in the software industry, I of course had to\n  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10874960\">\n   reply\n  </a>\n  . After some further back-and-forth on Twitter, Carmack\n  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10882202\">\n   followed up\n  </a>\n  .\n </p>\n <p>\n  First off, thanks to Mr. Carmack for writing such a thorough reply in good faith. I suppose internet arguments have made me a bit cynical in that I didn\u2019t expect that. I still definitely don\u2019t agree, but I think there\u2019s a legitimate analysis of the available evidence there now, at least.\n </p>\n <p>\n  When trying to post this reply to HN, I was told that the comment was too long, and I suppose it is a bit long for a comment. So, without further ado, here are my further thoughts on working hours.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   ... if only the workers in Greece would ease up a bit, they would get the productivity of Germany. Would you make that statement?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Not as such, no. This is a hugely complex situation mixing together finance, culture, management, international politics, monetary policy, and a bunch of other things. That study, and most of the others I linked to, is interesting in that it confirms the general model of ability-to-work (i.e. \u201cconcentration\u201d or \u201cwillpower\u201d) as a finite resource that you exhaust throughout the day; not in that \u201creduction in working hours\u201d is a panacea solution. Average productivity-per-hour-worked would definitely go up.\n </p>\n <p>\n  However, I do believe (and now we are firmly off into interpretation-of-results territory, I have nothing empirical to offer you here) that if the average Greek worker were\n  <em>\n   less stressed\n  </em>\n  to the degree of the average German one, combining issues like\n  <em>\n   both\n  </em>\n  overwork\n  <em>\n   and\n  </em>\n  the presence of a constant catastrophic financial crisis in the news, yes; they\u2019d achieve equivalent productivity.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   Total net productivity per worker, discounting for any increases in errors and negative side effects, continues increasing well past 40 hours per week. ... Only when you are so broken down that even when you come back the following day your productivity per hour is significantly impaired, do you open up the possibility of actually reducing your net output.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The trouble here is that you really cannot discount for errors and negative side effects, especially in the long term.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First of all, the effects of overwork (and attendant problems, like sleep deprivation) are\n  <em>\n   cumulative\n  </em>\n  . While productivity on a given day increases past 40 hours per week, if you continue to work more, you productivity will continue to degrade. So, the case where \u201cyou come back the following day ... impaired\u201d is pretty common... eventually.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Since none of this epidemiological work tracks individual performance longitudinally there are few conclusive demonstrations of this fact, but lots of compelling indications; in the past, I\u2019ve collected quantitative data on myself (and my reports, back when I used to be a manager) that strongly corroborates this hypothesis. So encouraging someone to work one sixty-hour week might be a completely reasonable trade-off to address a deadline; but building a culture where asking someone to work nights and weekends as a matter of course is inherently destructive. Once you get into the area where people are losing sleep (and for people with other responsibilities, it\u2019s not hard to get to that point) overwork starts impacting stuff like the ability to form long-term memories, which means that not only do you do less work, you also consistently improve less.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Furthermore, errors and negative side effects can have a disproportionate impact.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Let me narrow the field here to two professions I know a bit about and are germane to this discussion; one, health care, which the original article here starts off by referencing, and two, software development, with which we are both familiar (since you already raised the Mythical Man Month).\n </p>\n <p>\n  In medicine, you can do a lot of valuable life-saving work in a continuous 100-hour shift. And in fact residents are often required to do so as a sort of professional hazing ritual. However, you can also make catastrophic mistakes that would cost a person their life; this happens routinely. Study after study confirms this, and minor reforms happen, but residents are still routinely abused and made to work in inhumane conditions that have catastrophic outcomes for their patients.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In software, defects can be extremely expensive to fix. Not only are they hard to fix, they can also be hard to detect. The phenomenon of the\n  <a href=\"http://pyxisinc.com/NNPP_Article.pdf\">\n   Net Negative Producing Programmer\n  </a>\n  also indicates that not only can productivity drop to zero, it can drop\n  <em>\n   below\n  </em>\n  zero. On the anecdotal side, anyone who has had the unfortunate experience of cleaning up after a burnt-out co-worker can attest to this.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   There are a great many tasks where inefficiency grows significantly with additional workers involved; the Mythical Man Month problem is real. In cases like these, you are better off with a smaller team of harder working people, even if their productivity-per-hour is somewhat lower.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  The specific observation from the Mythical Man Month was that the number of communication links on a fully connected graph of employees increases geometrically whereas additional productivity (in the form of additional workers) increases linearly. If you have a well-designed organization, you can add people without requiring that your communication graph be fully connected.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But of course, you can\u2019t always do that. And specifically you can\u2019t do that\nwhen a project is already late: you already figured out how the work is going to be divided. Brooks\u2019 Law is formulated as: \u201cAdding manpower to a late software project makes it later.\u201d This is indubitable. But one of the other famous quotes from this book is \u201cThe bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.\u201d\n </p>\n <p>\n  The bearing of a child also takes nine months no matter how many hours a day the woman is assigned to work on it. So \u201cin cases like these\u201d my contention is that you are not \u201cbetter off with ... harder working people\u201d: you\u2019re just screwed. Some projects are impossible and you are better off acknowledging the fact that you made unrealistic estimates and you are going to fail.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   You called my post \u201cso wrong, and so potentially destructive\u201d, which leads me to believe that you hold an ideological position that the world would be better if people didn\u2019t work as long. I don\u2019t actually have a particularly strong position there; my point is purely about the effective output of an individual.\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  I do, in fact, hold such an ideological position, but I\u2019d like to think that said position is strongly justified by the data available to me.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But, I suppose calling it \u201cso potentially destructive\u201d might have seemed glib, if you are really just looking at the microcosm of what one individual might do on one given week at work, and not at the broader cultural implications of this commentary. After all, as this discussion shows, if you\n  <em>\n   are\n  </em>\n  really restricting your commentary to a single person on a single work-week, the case is substantially more ambiguous. So let me explain why I believe it\u2019s harmful, as opposed to merely being incorrect.\n </p>\n <p>\n  First of all, the problem is that you can\u2019t actually ignore the broader cultural implications. This is Hacker News, and you are John Carmack; you are practically a cultural institution yourself, and by using this site you are posting directly\n  <em>\n   into\n  </em>\n  the broader cultural implications of the software industry.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Software development culture, especially in the USA, suffers from a long-standing culture of chronic overwork. Startup developers in their metaphorical (and sometimes literal) garages are lionized and then eventually mythologized for spending so many hours on their programs. Anywhere that it is celebrated, this mythology rapidly metastasizes into a severe problem; the\n  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_march_%28project_management%29\">\n   Death March\n  </a>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Note that although the term \u201cdeath march\u201d is technically general to any project management, it applies \u201coriginally and especially in software development\u201d, because this problem is worse in the software industry (although it has been improving in recent years) than almost anywhere else.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So when John Carmack says on Hacker News that \u201cthe effective output of an individual\u201d will tend to increase with hours worked, that sends a message to many young and impressionable software developers. This is the exact same phenomenon that makes pop-sci writing terrible: your statement may be, in some limited context, and under some tight constraints, empirically correct, but it doesn\u2019t matter because when you expand the parameters to the full spectrum of these people\u2019s careers, it\u2019s both totally false and also a reinforcement of an existing cognitive bias and cultural trope.\n </p>\n <p>\n  I can\u2019t remember the name of this cognitive bias (and my Google-fu is failing me), but I know it exists. Let me call it the \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d bias. I know it exists because I have a friend who had the opportunity to go on a flight with NASA (on the Vomit Comet), and one of the more memorable parts of this experience that he related to me was the hypoxia test. The test involved basic math and spatial reasoning skills, but that test wasn\u2019t the point: the real test was that they had to notice and indicate when the oxygen levels were dropping and indicate that to the proctor. Concentrating on the test, many people failed the first few times, because the \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d bias makes it very hard to notice that you are impaired.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This is true of people who are drunk, or people who are sleep deprived, too. Their abilities are quantifiably impaired, but they have to reach a pretty severe level of impairment before they notice.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So people who are overworked might feel generally\n  <em>\n   bad\n  </em>\n  but they don\u2019t notice their productivity dropping until they\u2019re way over the red line.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Combine this with the fact that most people, especially those already employed as developers, are actually quite hard-working and earnest (laziness is much more common as a rhetorical device than as an actual personality flaw) and you end up in a scenario where a good software development manager is responsible much more for telling people to\n  <em>\n   slow down\n  </em>\n  , to take breaks, and to be more realistic in their estimates, than to speed up, work harder, and put in more hours.\n </p>\n <p>\n  The trouble is this goes against the manager\u2019s instincts as well. When you\u2019re a manager you tend to think of things in terms of resources: hours worked, money to hire people, and so on. So there\u2019s a constant nagging sensation for a manager to encourage people to work more hours in a day, so you can get more output (hours worked) out of your input (hiring budget). The problem here is that while all hours are equal, some hours are more equal than others. Managers have to fight against their own sense that a few more worked hours will be fine, and their employees\u2019 tendency to overwork because they\u2019re not noticing their own burnout,\n  <em>\n   and\n  </em>\n  upper management\u2019s tendency to demand more.\n </p>\n <p>\n  It is into this roiling stew of the relentless impulse to \u201cwork, work, work\u201d that we are throwing our commentary about whether it\u2019s a good idea or not to work more hours in the week. The scales are weighted very heavily on one side already - which happens to be the wrong side in the first place - and while we\u2019ve come back from the unethical and illegal brink we were at as an industry in the days of\n  <code>\n   ea_spouse\n  </code>\n  , software developers still generally work far too much.\n </p>\n <blockquote>\n  <p>\n   If we were fighting an existential threat, say an asteroid that would hit the earth in a year, would you really tell everyone involved in the project that they should go home after 35 hours a week, because they are harming the project if they work longer?\n  </p>\n </blockquote>\n <p>\n  Going back to my earlier explanation in this post about the cumulative impact of stress and sleep deprivation - if we were really fighting an existential threat, the equation changes somewhat. Specifically, the part of the equation where people can have meaningful downtime.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In such a situation, I would still want to make sure that people are as well-rested and as reasonably able to focus as they possibly can be. As you\u2019ve already acknowledged, there are \u201cincreases in errors\u201d when people are working too much, and we\n  <em>\n   REALLY\n  </em>\n  don\u2019t want the asteroid-targeting program that is going to blow apart the asteroid that will wipe out all life on earth to have \u201cincreased errors\u201d.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But there\u2019s also the problem that, faced with such an existential crisis, nobody is really going to be able to go home and enjoy a fine craft beer and spend some time playing with their kids and come back refreshed at 100% the next morning. They\u2019re going to be freaking out constantly about the comet, they\u2019re going to be losing sleep over that whether they\u2019re working or not. So, in such a situation, people should have the\n  <em>\n   option\n  </em>\n  to go home and relax if they\u2019re psychologically capable of doing so, but if the option for spending their time that makes them feel the most sane is working constantly and sleeping under their desk, well, that\u2019s the best one can do in that situation.\n </p>\n <p>\n  This metaphor is itself also misleading and out of place, though. There is also a strong cultural trend in software, especially in the startup ecosystem, to over-inflate the importance of what the company is doing - it is not \u201cchanging the world\u201d to create a website for people to order room-service for their dogs - and thereby to catastrophize any threat to that goal. The vast majority of the time, it is inappropriate to either to sacrifice -- or to ask someone else to sacrifice -- health and well-being for short-term gains. Remember, given the cumulative effects of overwork, that\u2019s all you even\n  <em>\n   can\n  </em>\n  get: short-term gains. This sacrifice often has a huge opportunity cost in other areas, as you can\u2019t focus on more important things that might come along later.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In other words, while the overtime situation is complex and delicate in the case of an impending asteroid impact, there\u2019s also the question of whether, at the beginning of Project Blow Up The Asteroid, I want everyone to be burnt out and overworked from their pet-hotel startup website. And in that case, I can say, unequivocally, no. I want them bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for what is sure to be a grueling project, no matter what the overtime policy is, that absolutely needs to happen. I want to make sure they didn\u2019t waste their youth and health on somebody else\u2019s stock valuation.\n </p>\n</div>",
